"""Einstein's famous equation states that the energy in an object at rest equals its mass times the square of the speed of light.  (The speed of light is 300,000,000 m/s.)

Complete the skeleton code below so that it:
* Accepts the mass of an object (remember to convert the input string to a number, in this case, a float).
* Calculate the energy, e
* Prints e"""

m = input("Input m: ")
m = float(m)

c = 300000000
e = m * c**2

print(e)
